Rhino UI
========

A working-in-progress UI (User-Interface) is available for Rhino 6+. After the base installation is executed open the terminal and
navigate to the location in which the source-code is stored in your computer. Make sure to be in the environmenment that you installed
``compas_tno`` and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m compas_tno.install

By default this will try to install ``TNO`` in Rhino 6.0. You can modify the version adding to this line the option ``--rhino_version 7.0`` to install it to Rhino 7.0 for example.
